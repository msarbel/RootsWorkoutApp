# RootsWorkoutApp

Term Project for BU MET CIS program CS701

Overall this project was geared towards the creation of an one-on-one interactive application. Give the ability to follow specific workout plans, track and adjust on the go, look at video examples for main movements, and gym finder google map API. Further introduction of hooking up with an online coach to guide the client with both custom plans and the ability for the client to create their own workouts. A even broader step would be live visual feedback of movement patterns through a live stream capability to promote instant feedback and a virtual personal training session. 


Will update 5/2/2018

** Next steps for functionality **
